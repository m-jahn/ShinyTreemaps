# \item{filter}{(numeric) Filter the supplied data frame to remove very small
# cells that may not be visible. The default is to remove cells with a 
# relative target area below a threshold of zero (no negative values allowed). 
# The algorithm can fail when processing many tiny cells so it can be 
# worthwhile to simply rerun the function with a stricter filter.}
# 
# \item{cell_size}{(character) The name of the column used to control cell size. 
# Can be one of \code{levels} or any other column with numerical data. NA or
# values equal or less than zero are not allowed as the cell area needs to be positive.
# The values in this column are aggregated by the function specified by \code{fun}.
# If \code{cell_size = NULL}, cell area is simply computed by the number of members
# for the respective cell (corresponding to rows in the data.frame).}
# 
# \item{custom_color}{(character) An optional column that can be specified to
# control cell color. Cell colors are determined when drawing the treemap
# using \code{\link{drawTreemap}}, but the default is to use one of 
# \code{levels} or \code{cell size}. Any other data source that shall be used
# instead has to be included in the treemap generation and explicitly 
# specified here. The default value is \code{NULL}.}
# 
# \item{shape}{(list or character) Set the initial shape of the treemap. Currently
# supported are the keywords "rectangle", "rounded_rect", "circle" or "hexagon".
# Alternatively the user can supply a named list with coordinates for a custom polygon.
# The slots of the list must be labeled 'x' and 'y'. The coordinates are not tested
# for validity, use on your own risk.}
# 
# \item{maxIteration}{(numeric) Force algorithm to stop at this number of iterations
# for each parent cell. The algorithm usually converges to an acceptable 
# solution fairly quickly, so it seems reasonable to restrict this number
# in order to save computation time. However, more iterations give higher
# accuracy.}
# 
# \item{error_tol}{(numeric) The allowed maximum error tolerance of a cell.
# The algorithm will stop when all cells have lower error than this value.
# It is calculated as the absolute difference of a cell's area to its target
# area. The default is 0.01 (or 1 %) of the total parental area. Note: this
# is is different from a relative per-cell error, where 1 % would be more 
# strict.}
# 
# \item{seed}{(integer) The default seed is NULL, which will lead to a new 
# random sampling of cell coordinates for each tesselation. If you want
# a reproducibloe arrangement of cells, set seed to an arbitrary number.}
# 
# \item{positioning}{(character) Algorithm for positioning of starting 
# coordinates of child cells in the parental cell using \code{spsample()};
# "random" for completely random positions, "regular" for cells aligned 
# to a grid sorted from bottom to top by name, "clustered" with regular 
# positions of cells but sorted by name from inside out. Two variants 
# "regular_by_area" and "clustered_by_area" will work as their counterparts 
# but will sort by cell target area instead of cell name. \code{positioning}
# can be a single character or a vector of \code{length(levels)} to allow
# different positioning algorithms for each level.}
